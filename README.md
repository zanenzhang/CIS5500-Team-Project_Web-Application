**Abstract:**
Founded in 2005, YouTube is one of the most visited websites in the world and boasts over 35 billion monthly visits1. Hosting videos from a plethora of different categories and countries, YouTube naturally offers a rich catalog of data from which to build a database application. As YouTube videos possess diverse details and classifiers and are hosted on channels with a separately unique set of details, an opportunity exists to perform complex database queries and deliver valuable insights as well as potentially engaging video content.

With features and tools covered in this course, application performance could also be improved with the implementation of indexes, database form normalization, and query optimization. The TubeDB web application aims to provide data on YouTube videos and channels to users in addition to offering video content that aligns with user interests and search specifications. Across the wide spectrum from educational interests at one end to entertainment at the other, TubeDB hopes to deliver an appealing user experience.   

**Introduction:**
The primary motivation to pursue this database application was driven by the bountiful availability of relevant YouTube video and channel data. The YouTube datasets that were acquired had a level of quality and a desirable size most suitable for the needs of the project as well as the team’s available computing and hosting resources. Given the popularity of the YouTube video platform, potential users of TubeDB would already be familiar with the underlying details and functionality. Additionally, with the general public’s existing affinity towards certain existing videos or channels, the application would be likely to resonate well with a greater degree of potential users. Other potential application ideas were also evaluated pertaining to video games, books, and cars, but ultimately the accessible data supporting these ideas was unsatisfactory in terms of the size as well as breadth and depth of data. 

The web application could help solve or improve convenience related problems with securing or visualizing data on certain YouTube videos or channels. By including complex database queries into the application on video and channel details, users could uncover or visualize insights either not available elsewhere or in a more efficient and convenient fashion. For example, users could utilize the web app to determine which categories of videos were trending at certain dates and in certain countries, as well as which channels were hosting trending videos. TubeDB could also be a source of helpful information for content creators and advertisers who are looking for data on channel viewership and trends, the cycle of video virality and popular adoption, trending video content and category themes, as well as video trends across geographies. Content creators could also leverage data on video trends and themes to generate more viral videos in the future and advertisers could leverage this data to better tailor their marketing campaigns.
 
With regards to functionality, TubeDB will allow users to browse, watch, search, favorite and be informed of the most popular Youtube videos, either for personal entertainment or to help users keep up-to-date on societal trends. The search functionality will be flexible to encompass a wide permutation of parameters across multiple database tables. Users will also be able to peruse the most popular or personally preferred YouTube channels as well as search and view content related to these channels. Users will also be able to save favorite videos for viewing at a later time and be recommended additional video content based on user favorites.
